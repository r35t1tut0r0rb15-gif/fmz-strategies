"""EMA 20 / 50 crossings, broker days: the cross up goes long, the cross down goes short; reversing.
Port of FMZ strategy #477549 "Dual EMA Crossover Dynamic Trend Following Quantitative Trading Strategy" (EMA Crossover Buy/Sell Signals).

FMZ source id: 477549

Source
    https://www.fmz.com/strategy/477549 (PineScript v5, FMZ last modified 2025-01-06 13:42:11).
    Verbatim copy: original_source.md. Read 2026-10-22 (FMZ-C).

Original signal (original_source.md lines 89-151), EMA 20 / 50; a home-made position flag with limit exits at the signal close
    crossover -> entry Long;  crossunder -> entry Short;  flag long and crossunder -> exit(Long, limit = close);  flag short and crossover -> exit(Short, limit = close)

Interpretation choices (Pine rules in SURVEY_README.md)
    * Every exit signal is also the opposite entry on the same bar: the market entry reverses the
      position at the next open, so the limit exits at the signal close are cancelled with the position
      they belonged to and never act. The script's own position flag only gates those exits. REVERSAL
      INTENDED. No sizing code. Daily bars are broker days (17:00 America/New_York), stamped with their
      first minute. FREQ = "1D" from the backtest header.

Admission criteria
    1 fits the interface: PASS, bar-close orders.
    2 generic: PASS, EMA crossings.
    3 crypto-exchange-only: no (exchange pair in the header only).
    4 signals only: no sizing code.
    5 ranges declared: GRID below (4 trials), before any backtest.
    6 near-duplicates: no DG / ND group; ported (rule 7).
    7 FMZ performance claims: ignored.
Volume: not used (check 8).
Session open: broker day (17:00 America/New_York, DST by the zone); no venue-open rule.
REVERSAL INTENDED.
